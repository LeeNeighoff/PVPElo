- Fixed logic error when setting base and max adjustment
    - Would set the value before checking against the other, but only write to config after check
- Added configurable max ratio
    - Integer option

    1. Check if victim rating is 1. If yes, adjustment is 0
    2. Check if max ratio is exceeded. If yes, adjustment is 0
    3. Check if max portion is exceeded. If yes, adjustment is capped to max portion.
    4. Check if max adjustment is exceeded. If yes, adjustment is capped to max adjustment.
