PvP Elo adds in a rating system based on PvP performance, measured with an elo score. Defeating a player raises your rating, while dying to a player lowers your rating. The amount of elo lost or gained depends on how your rating stacks up against your opponent. This structure encourages players to take on skilled targets instead of grinding weak players.

Features:
    Fair rating system that encourages taking on tougher opponents, while discouraging bulling weaker players
    High configurability for many options, including base elo adjustment after a fight, max rating ratio between fighters before adjustments reduce to 0, maximum percentage of elo able to be lost in a single fight, and more!
    Ability to check your own stats as well as the stats of others
    Graphical leaderboard showing top players and their stats, as well as your own to compare
        Text-in-chat leaderboard also available
    Placeholder to add to your chat plugin that shows a player's rating next to their name (placeholder: varElo)
    NametagEdit support to add ratings to nametags (NametagAPI currently only supports 1.20.1 and below)
